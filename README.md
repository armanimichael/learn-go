# learn-go

Documented code to learn Go language.

## How does it work?

Instead of writing blog posts about Go, I will create different folders containing similar concepts and documenting them via comments.<br/>

## Requirements

If you'd like to run the snippets on your machine, you'll have to download and install the [Go binaries](https://golang.org/dl/) from their website.

Optionally, you can install a code editor. I personally advice using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/), as they're free and have both officially supported plugins for the Go language.

## Running the Code Snippets

Every snippet works individually, unless stated othervise. You can run one by using the `go run snippet-name.go` command.

## Currently Available Snippets

- [Hello World](./hello-world/hello-world.go)
- Variables
  - [Variables and Constants](./variables/variables-and-constants.go)
